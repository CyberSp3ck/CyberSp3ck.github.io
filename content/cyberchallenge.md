Every year, we participate in the programme [Cyberchallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/) program, a training program for students between the age of 16 and 24 to build the next generation of cyber security professionals.
At the [University of Trento](https://cyberchallenge.it/venues/unitn), we run a training program for a selected number of students with lectures and laboratories in the Malaware Lab.

The [Students registration](https://cyberchallenge.it/students) should open soon, keep an eye on their website!
