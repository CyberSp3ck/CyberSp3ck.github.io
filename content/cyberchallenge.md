Every year, we participate to [Cyberchallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/), a training program for students between the age of 16 and 24 to build the next generation of cyber security professionals.
At the [University of Trento](https://cyberchallenge.it/venues/unitn), we run a training program for a selected number of students with lectures and laboratories on different topics, such as:

- Web Security
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation (pwn)
- Network Security
- Some forensics, a *bit* of OSINT

The [Students registration](https://cyberchallenge.it/students) is open!

If you are a student at UniTN and want to be notified, join [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/BTXZ7EFM5Y).
